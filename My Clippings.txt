more possible, than ever to build a significant business on your own with no employees. An important related issue is the perception of extraordinary high risk generally associated with starting your own venture. In all likelihood, almost all of the 56% of Americans (you or the person sitting next to you) who would like to be their own boss are aware of the high failure rate often cited for start-ups. The generally accepted rule of thumb is that 40% of new businesses die within the first year, and that over 80% of start-ups fail within the first five years. With widely reported odds like that, it’s no wonder that people with ongoing financial responsibilities stay put.

CHAPTER SUMMARY 

I learned that it is ok to grieve. I grieved for my loss of love 22 years ago. Like David I need to grieve. I tend to bottle things up and it is unhealthy. I must cry and grive my loss. Like David I must share my discouragement and disappointment with God. I don’t do it because I do not think God cares for me. 

I can bring my hurts and grievances to God before I sleep every night. It could be a10 minute activity.

Are you in difficulty about your way? Go to God with your question; get direction from the light of his smile or the cloud of his refusal. . . . get alone, where the lights and shadows of earth cannot interfere, where the disturbance of self-will does not intrude, where human opinions fail to reach—. . . wait there silent and expectant, though all around you insist on immediate decision or action—the will of God will be made clear; and you will have . . . a new conception of God, [and] a deeper insight into his nature.2

Chapter Summary:

God created work and it was a joy to Him. He rested on the 7th day not because He was tired but you appreciate the work He has done. 

Humans are created with the need to work. They get restless and depressed if they don’t work. God has designed work to give meaning to human lives. 

Though work gives meaning to human existence; it should never become an idol. The right way to approach work is through worshipful attitude. When God is at the centre of a person’s being work provides the joy and sense of accomplishment and validation we all need as humans. Like God, humans too need to rest; not just to recharge and replenish their energy but to enjoy the fruit of labor of his hands.
